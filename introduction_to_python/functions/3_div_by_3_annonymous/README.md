## Motivation
The **filter()** method filters the given sequence with the help of a function that tests each element in the sequence to be true or not. A **lambda** function is a single-line function declared with no name, which can have any number of arguments, but it can only have one expression

## Problem Description
Write a python function `div_by_3` with a variable-length arguement `*args` of integers, and using a lambda function, output all the numbers in `*args` divisible by three.
Hint: Use an anonymous function to filter and compare if divisible or not.
